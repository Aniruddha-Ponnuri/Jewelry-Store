## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Improved Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks with detailed error logging
- Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Console logging at each step of the deletion process

### 2. **Better User Feedback**
- Individual button states (`deletingProducts` Set) for each product
- "Deleting..." text shown on the specific button being clicked
- Buttons disabled during deletion to prevent multiple clicks
- Error alerts shown immediately to user
- Prominent error display at top of page

### 3. **Enhanced Deletion Process**
- Verify product exists before attempting deletion
- Better image cleanup (continues deletion even if image removal fails)
- Proper async/await handling throughout the process
- Cache revalidation after successful deletion
- Admin status refresh to prevent privilege loss

### 4. **Robust State Management**
- Separate loading state for individual products instead of global loading
- Proper cleanup of loading states in finally blocks
- Error state management with clear user messaging

## Key Changes Made

### In `src/app/admin/products/page.tsx`:

1. **Added deletingProducts state**:
   ```typescript
   const [deletingProducts, setDeletingProducts] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())
   ```

2. **Enhanced deleteProduct function**:
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Individual product deletion tracking
   - Better user confirmation message
   - Improved error messages and user feedback

3. **Updated delete button**:
   - Individual disabled state per product
   - Dynamic text showing deletion status
   - Proper accessibility

4. **Error display**:
   - Added prominent error alert at top of page
   - Immediate user feedback via alert dialogs

## Testing Instructions

1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Open admin products page
   - Try deleting a product
   - Check browser console for detailed logs
   - Verify UI feedback (button states, error messages)

2. **Console Testing**:
   - Load the test script: `test-delete-product.js`
   - Run `testDeleteProduct()` in browser console
   - Verify buttons are properly configured

3. **Error Scenarios**:
   - Test with invalid product IDs
   - Test with network disconnection
   - Test with missing images
   - Verify proper error handling in each case

## Expected Behavior

1. **Successful Deletion**:
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - Button shows "Deleting..." state
   - Product removed from list
   - Console shows success logs

2. **Failed Deletion**:
   - Error message displayed prominently
   - Button returns to normal state
   - Detailed error logged to console
   - User gets immediate feedback

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Multiple rapid clicks prevented
   - Image deletion failures don't stop product deletion
   - Admin privileges maintained after deletion

## Files Modified

- `src/app/admin/products/page.tsx` - Main delete functionality
- `test-delete-product.js` - Testing utility (optional)

The delete product functionality should now be much more reliable with better error handling, user feedback, and debugging capabilities.
